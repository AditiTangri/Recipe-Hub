# 🍲 Open Recipe Hub

**Open Recipe Hub** is an open-source web application where users can share, discover, and rate recipes.  
It’s designed to be beginner-friendly and open for contributions during Hacktoberfest and beyond.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The project allows users to:
- Submit and store recipes (ingredients, steps, images).
- Search recipes by ingredient, category, or difficulty.
- Rate and favorite recipes.
- Explore a collaborative hub of user-contributed cooking ideas.

---

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The system is organized into core components and flows:

### 🔹 Core Components
- **API (FastAPI backend)**  
  - Handles recipe submission, retrieval, and search.  
  - Provides authentication and user profile endpoints.  

- **Web UI (React + Tailwind)**  
  - User-friendly interface for browsing and submitting recipes.  
  - Displays recipe details, ratings, and search filters.  

- **Storage (SQLite / PostgreSQL)**  
  - Stores recipe data, user info, ratings, and media.  

---

### 🔹 Request/Response Flow
- `/recipes` → Add or retrieve recipes.  
- `/search` → Search by ingredients or filters.  
- `/ratings` → Rate or favorite a recipe.  
- `/users` → Manage authentication and profiles.  

---

### 🔹 Data Models
- **Recipe**: title, description, ingredients, steps, tags, image, created_by, created_at  
- **User**: username, email, password (hashed), joined_at  
- **Rating**: user_id, recipe_id, stars, comment, timestamp  

---

### 🔹 Extensibility
- Add new recipe categories (e.g., vegan, desserts).  
- Improve search functionality (full-text, filters).  
- Add social features (comments, sharing).  
- Multi-language recipe support.  

---

### 🔹 Deployment
- **Local Development** → Run backend (FastAPI) + frontend (React) with Docker or dev scripts.  
- **Docker Compose** → One command setup for API, Web, and DB.  

---

### 🔹 Non-Functional Goals
- Modular architecture (easy to extend).  
- Lightweight (runs locally with minimal setup).  
- Beginner-friendly contribution workflow.
